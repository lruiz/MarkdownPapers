What is MarkdownPapers?
=======================

MarkdownPapers is a java implementation of Markdown language created by [John Gruber] in collaboration 
with [Aaron Swartz], which provides an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format that takes many cues from 
existing conventions for marking up plain text in email.

This implementation consist in parser built from a [JAVACC] grammar definition that produces an
abstract syntax tree ([AST]) where transformations are performed following the [Visitor Pattern].

Quick example
-------------

The most prominent component would be org.tautua.markdownpapers.Markdown which receives a java.io.Reader
(input content) and java.io.Writer (output).

    Reader in = new FileReader("in.md");
    Writer out = new FileWriter("out.html");

    Markdown md = new Markdown();
    md.transform(in, out);

And if you need to handle the AST by your own...

    Reader in = new FileReader("in.md");
    Visitor v = new HtmlEmitter();
    Parser parser = new Parser(in);

    Document doc = parser.parse();
    doc.accept(v);
